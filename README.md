# Spacecraft Simulation Project ðŸš€

## **Overview**
This project simulates the motion of multiple spacecraft under the influence of thrust and gravity. It allows users to:
- Add spacecraft dynamically during runtime.
- Visualize trajectories and fuel consumption.
- Animate the real-time motion of spacecraft.

## **Features**
1. **Multi-Spacecraft Simulation**:
   - Simulate multiple spacecraft with unique parameters.
   - Configurations are loaded from `spacecrafts.json` or dynamically added by the user.

2. **Real-Time Visualization**:
   - Static and animated trajectory plots for all spacecraft.
   - Fuel consumption tracking over time.

3. **Landing Analysis**:
   - Determines whether spacecraft land safely or crash based on velocity and fuel levels.

4. **Interactive Inputs**:
   - Users can define new spacecraft and adjust parameters during runtime.

## **Setup and Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd SpacecraftSimulation
   code .
